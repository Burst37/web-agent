  Rapid UI layout ideation using Google Stitch (Google Labs AI UI prototyping tool at
  stitch.withgoogle.com). Use IMMEDIATELY when the user wants to see layout variations quickly,
  prototype a screen before coding, or generate UI mockups for review. This is STAGE 2.5
  (LAYOUT PROTOTYPE) of the SA master website pipeline — Premium path only, skipped entirely
  on the Standard/mass-production path. Sits between spaceage-savo-creative-director-os +
  ui-ux-designer (direction) and cinematic-website-builder (production). Trigger when user says
  "show me what it could look like," "give me layout options," "prototype this fast," "stitch
  this up," or when a Handoff Package arrives from UI/UX Designer with next_step: google_stitch.

# GOOGLE STITCH SKILL
## Space Age AI Solutions — Rapid UI Prototyping Layer

Google Stitch (https://stitch.withgoogle.com) is a Google Labs AI tool that generates UI screens from natural language. It sits between the creative-direction layer (SAVO + UI/UX Designer) and Cinematic Website Builder (production). It is NOT the final deliverable — it is the layout proof that gets handed to production.

> **Pipeline position:** Stage 2.5 of the SA master pipeline, **Premium path only**. Named
> clients (Encore, Holy H.O.E., high-ticket) get a human layout review here before Stage 3
> build; Standard/mass-production leads skip straight from Stage 2 (Direction) to Stage 3
> (Build) — this is the actual lever that makes mass production fast, not a step to add back
> in for volume work.

## STITCH PROMPT FORMULA

[SCREEN TYPE] for [PRODUCT NAME], [MOODBOARD AESTHETIC],
[KEY SECTIONS in order], [COLOR PALETTE with hex codes],
[TYPOGRAPHY direction], [SPECIFIC COMPONENTS],
[DEVICE FORMAT], [TONE DESCRIPTOR]

---

## THE 6 STITCH PROMPT TYPES

### TYPE 1 — Full Page Layout
Full landing page for [PRODUCT]. [MOODBOARD] aesthetic.
Sections in order: [1], [2], [3], [4].
Color palette: bg=[hex], primary=[hex], accent=[hex].
Font direction: [display font] + [body font]. Desktop-first.

### TYPE 2 — Single Section / Component
[SECTION NAME] section for [PRODUCT] website.
Contains: [list elements]. Aesthetic: [moodboard].
Colors: [palette]. Show desktop + mobile version.

### TYPE 3 — Dashboard / Data UI (LoyaltyBot, analytics)
Dashboard screen for [PRODUCT]. Data: [metrics/widgets list].
Aesthetic: Hardware Console / Dark Data-Viz. Dark background, [accent] LEDs.
Layout: sidebar nav + main content + status bar.
Components: live counters, progress bars, status indicators, log feed. Desktop only.

### TYPE 4 — Mobile-First Screen
Mobile app screen for [PRODUCT]. Screen: [type].
[iOS/Android] style, [light/dark] mode. Contains: [components].
Aesthetic: [moodboard]. Show bottom tab navigation.

### TYPE 5 — Variation Set (pick a direction)
Generate 3 layout variations for the hero section of [PRODUCT].
Variation A: [layout description].
Variation B: [layout description].
Variation C: [layout description].
All use: [moodboard] aesthetic, [colors], [font direction].

### TYPE 6 — Faithful Reconstruction from Reference
Use only when the brief is "match this specific site/screenshot," not "design something new."

Recreate [REFERENCE SITE/SCREENSHOT] as closely as possible. This is a faithful
reconstruction, not a redesign, not "inspired by." Match the layout, proportions, spacing,
color behavior, interaction pacing, and emotional tone.

Treat the reference as ground truth. List, explicitly:
- what to preserve exactly (layout structure, panel proportions, spacing rhythm, hierarchy)
- what NOT to introduce (no new UI elements, no modernizing, no generic patterns not present
  in the source)
- the strict constraints ("Do not add cards/buttons/CTAs not in the original," "Faithful
  reconstruction is the highest priority")

**Refinement pass** (run after the first Stitch output, before moving to Stage 3): treat
the *first Stitch output itself* as the new ground truth reference and issue a second,
narrower prompt — "refine this to match [reference] exactly; keep everything already
correct (hover effects, transitions, animations); fix only layout, proportions, alignment,
and spacing." Never re-describe the whole screen twice — the refinement pass corrects
deltas, it doesn't restate the brief.

  )
}
```

### SPLINE INTEGRATION — Real WebGL Refraction

For true light-bending liquid glass (not CSS approximation), use Spline:

1. In Spline: create a glass mesh object → Material → set `Transmission: 1.0`, `IOR: 1.5`, `Roughness: 0.05`
2. Add environment map (HDR) for reflections
3. Export as Spline scene → embed in Framer via `<Spline scene="[url]" />`
4. Layer Framer text components OVER the Spline embed using `z-index`
5. Use Framer scroll events to drive Spline camera position via `spline.emitEvent()`

When to use Spline vs CSS glass:
- Hero showcase moment, full-bleed glass object → Spline (real refraction)
- Cards, navbars, panels, UI components → CSS + Framer (performance, scalability)
- Mobile → CSS only (Spline is GPU-heavy)

---

### LIQUID GLASS → CINEMATIC WEBSITE BUILDER HANDOFF

Add to the special_effects array in the handoff YAML:

```yaml
special_effects:
  - type: liquid_glass_typography
    target_sections: [hero, features]  # which sections use glass
    glass_variant: dark  # dark | light | colorized | transparent-text
    implementation: framer  # framer | spline | css-only
    tokens:
      glass_blur: 24px
      glass_fill: "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)"
      glass_border: "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)"
      glass_radius: 20px
      glass_shadow: "0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)"
    animation:
      entrance: scroll_reveal  # scroll_reveal | fade | none
      hover: 3d_tilt  # 3d_tilt | highlight_shift | none
      spring: { stiffness: 300, damping: 30, mass: 0.8 }
```

---

### LIQUID GLASS DO / DO NOT

DO:
- Specify exact rgba values in Stitch prompts — Stitch uses them for fill reference
- Always describe the glass as a LAYER above the background, not as the background itself
- Mention "backdrop blur visible" in Stitch prompt so output shows translucency intent
- Use Tokens Studio token names when handing off to production
- Use Framer's `useSpring` for all hover physics — never CSS transitions for glass tilt
- Test on dark backgrounds first — glass reads poorly on white without tuning

DO NOT:
- Ask Stitch to generate the actual blur effect — it makes static mockups, describe the intent
- Use `filter: blur()` on the glass element itself — that blurs content, not background
- Skip the specular highlight layer — without it, glass looks flat and plasticky
- Use pure white (#FFFFFF) glass fill — always semi-transparent rgba
- Put glass on glass without increasing blur significantly (min 32px for nested glass)
- Use Spline for mobile glass components — use CSS fallback

## PROMPT WRITING RULES

DO:
- Name the actual product — Stitch uses it for context
- Specify exact hex codes from your design system
- List sections in page order
- Name specific UI components
- Specify desktop or mobile
- Specify dark/light mode explicitly

DO NOT:
- Be vague — generates garbage
- Ask for animations — Stitch makes static mockups
- Request more than 5-6 sections per prompt
- Skip font direction
- Forget the tone descriptor
